    "# 5.3 Particle Filter for Robot Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with problems of a stochastic nature (meaning, the processes involved are random), there are two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first approach is to work **analytically**, with an explicitly defined probability distribution (.e.g., a Gaussian one), and estimate the parameters of that distribution. This is what we did with the Extended Kalman Filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second one is to generate many **random samples**, and follow what happens to each of them as they are subjected to the randomness of the process. Crucially, each of these samples represents a single, determined value, rather than a probability distribution, and is thus easier to work with. Techniques using this second approach are often referred to as *Monte Carlo Methods*, and are very common in many disciplines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will see a sample-based technique for probabilistic estimation, and apply it to the problem of robot localization. This technique goes by multiple names, such as *Monte Carlo Localization*, but we will refer to it with the generic term of **Particle Filter**. Specifically, we will:\n",
    "- Get an intuition about what a particle is (section 5.3.1),\n",
    "- Implement the building blocks of the filter (section 5.3.2), and\n",
    "- Put them all together to perform localization (section 5.3.3)."

    "## 5.3.1 But, what is a particle?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to represent a probability distribution with a finite set of discrete values, we can do this by repeatedly sampling the distribution. In the context of Monte Carlo methods, that is precisely how we generate particles: by drawing samples from a distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes it a **particle**, rather than just a **sample**, is that a particle will later be transformed by *other* random samples. That is, a particle holds state, and that state can evolve over time. Let's see a toy example to solidify our understanding of this concept.\n"
