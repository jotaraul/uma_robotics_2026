    "# 7.4 SLAM Demo in ROS2\n",
    "\n",
    "In real applications, the problem of SLAM is unnavoidable. When a robot is required to move through an environment to carry out any task, we always want to have a map of that environment for path planning, localization, *etc.* These maps can sometimes contain application-specific information (*e.g.* semantic maps), but the most common type of map is without a doubt the geometric map, as navigation and localization are universally useful to all applications of mobile robotics. And, of course, we need SLAM techniques to build these maps, rather than pure mapping ones, as the localization of the robot is not known while the map is being built.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we saw how to build a type of geometric map (an *occupancy grid*) with Pose Graph Optimization SLAM. The reason we chose that technique is that it is one of the most commonly used ones in real applications. For example, in ROS2 we can find the `slam_toolbox` package, which implements several slight variants of Pose Graph SLAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like we discussed in the case of Particle Filter Localization and `AMCL`, these \"real\" implementations do more than what we have seen: additional techniques we have not discussed are used to obtain better results and to reduce computation time. Still, the core algorithm being employed is largely the same as what we implemented in the previous lesson."

    "The provided package `slam_demo` contains the resources and configuration files you will need. Once again, we will use `mvsim` to handle the simulation of the robot movement and the laser scanner. The `slam_toolbox` node will run the Pose Graph SLAM algorithm and generate the map. Lastly, we will use our familiar tools, `rviz` and `keyboard_control`, to handle visualization and to move the robot. \n",
