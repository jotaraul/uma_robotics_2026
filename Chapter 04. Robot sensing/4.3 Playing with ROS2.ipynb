    "Let's now do something a little less theoretically intensive. We are going to have a look at a laser scanner being simulated by a professional robotic simulator, **MVSim**, within the infrastructure of ROS2.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, ROS2 allows for the intercommunication of different *nodes* (executables) through a system of *topics* and *messages*. When using a simulator node like **MVSim**, this node will be responsible for handling the calculations that generate the response of the sensors, and the result of this process will be published as a message on a specific topic. Then, any node which wants to use the sensor response can access it simply by subscribing to the topic and receiving the corresponding messages."
