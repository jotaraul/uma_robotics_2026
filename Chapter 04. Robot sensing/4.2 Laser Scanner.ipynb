    "# 4.2 Laser Scanners\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most widely used types of range/bearing sensors is the 2D LiDAR (*Light-based Detection And Ranging*) or laser scanner. Their principle of operation is simple: the sensor emits a pulse of light of a particular frequency, and waits for it to be reflected back by the environment. Once the reflected pulse is received, the distance it has traveled can be calculated from the time-of-flight (TOF).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D scanner repeats this operation many times while rotating around its own center, thus obtaining information about the distance to the environment at different angles on its plane of operation. The main parameters that describe a laser scanner are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The angle increment between one measurement and the next is the **angular resolution** of the scanner, and determines how detailed the complete measurement is.\n",
    "- The **field of view (FOV)** determines the angle limits of where the scan starts and stops. While some commercial LiDARs are capable of scanning all around themselves, it is often necessary to limit the FOV due to where the sensor is mounted on the robot (as we want to prevent the sensor from observing the body of the robot itself).\n",
    "- The **max distance**, past which the sensor is not able to produce a measurement at all.\n",
    "- The **noise**, of course. You know how this goes by now: sensor measurements are never fully reliable. Depending on the specifics of the sensor, the uncertainty of the measurements might only be reported for the *distance* reading (that is, a scalar **variance**), or for both the distance and the angle (a **covariance matrix**).  \n",
